## Setup

In order to setup, you need to have Open JDK, Kotlin, Groovy, Gradle and the Android SDK installed.
Add a `local.properties` file to the root of the Android client module with the following line:

```text
sdk.dir = /home/USERNAME/Android/Sdk
```

if you are a Linux distro user, otherwise if you use Mac do the following:

```text
sdk.dir = /Users/USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk
```

Finally, if you are a Windows user, then remove Windows, install Linux and then use the first solution.
